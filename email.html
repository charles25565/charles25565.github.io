     <h1>Email providers list</h1>
     <p>This list covers only providers that aren't covered by <a href="http://diggy.club/articles/email.xhtml" target="_blank">Dig Deeper's email provider list</a>. It's really detailed, check it out too.</p>
     <p>Also note that this has a perspective of pretty extreme threat models, if you want something that just works, just stick with Tuta Mail, which works for most non-advanced threat models.</p>
     <p>Furthermore, this page is an early WIP.</p>
     <h2>Atomic Mail</h2>
     <p>An email service that looks great on the surface. Turns out, despite the privacy policy, they do use analytics scripts:</p>
     <img src="/atomicmailanalytics.png" alt="Ahrefs analytics script tag in the home page code">
     <p>At least they aren't in the actual app, this was similar behavior to how Skiff operated.</p>
     <p>The encryption isn't really specified anywhere seemingly, so its better off just assumed unencrypted.</p>
     <p>Another dubious claim is that they are GDPR compliant, yet they allegedly have no automatic account deletion, which is needed to be GDPR compliant.</p>
     <p>There also doesn't seem to be any email client support, only a web interface. You have to trust what the server gives you, and it is trivial to send different content to different IP addresses.</p>
     <p>Luckily, they don't seem to be blocking anonymizers, but who cares if they have made multiple other mistakes? Lmao.</p>
     <p>I will not be providing links to this service, as I cannot recommend it.</p>
