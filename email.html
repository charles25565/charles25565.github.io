     <h1>Email providers list</h1>
     <p>This list covers only providers that aren't covered by <a href="http://diggy.club/articles/email.xhtml" target="_blank">Dig Deeper's email provider list</a>. It's really detailed, check it out too.</p>
     <p>Also note that this has a perspective of pretty extreme threat models, if you want something that just works, just stick with Tuta Mail, which works for most non-advanced threat models.</p>
     <p>Furthermore, this page is an early WIP.</p>
     <p>The content below is not to be used to attack the providers or their developers, nor is an attack itself, and outlines objective issues. Remember, depending on threat model, poorly rated services here may be fine for you.</p>

     <h2>Atomic Mail</h2>
     <p>An email service that looks great on the surface. Turns out, contrary to the privacy policy, they do use non-self-hosted analytics scripts:</p>
     <img src="/atomicmailanalytics.png" alt="Ahrefs analytics script tag in the home page code">
     <p>At least they aren't in the actual app, this was similar behavior to how Skiff operated.</p>
     <p>It is specified on various parts of the website that it does use AES-256, etc, but it is very unclear about the encryption. Very suspicious.</p>
     <p>Another dubious claim is that they are GDPR compliant, yet they allegedly have no automatic account deletion, which is needed to be GDPR compliant.</p>
     <p>There also doesn't seem to be any email client support, only a web interface. You have to trust what the server gives you, and it is trivial to send different content to different IP addresses.</p>
     <p>Luckily, they don't seem to be blocking anonymizers, but doesn't help much.</p>
     <p>Data retention after skimming looks similar to Cock.li.</p>
     <p>After some extra digging, I found the site is operated by a John Smith (yeah, right?), and appears to have an Estonian address, etc. despite being supposedly in Germany. All from looking at a schema.org script.</p>
     <p>I will not be providing links to this service, as I cannot recommend it.</p>

     <h2>Monocles</h2>
     <p>Monocles is a pretty uncommon service, but you might've heard of it if you browsed F-Droid or did lots of digging.</p>
     <p>Firstly, they don't just not block anonymizers, they actually encourage it:</p>
     <blockquote cite="https://docs.monocles.eu/services/services/">In case of censorship, we do recommend to use monocles Browser over Tor using Orbot or Tor Browser on your desktop or ideally boot into Tails for maximum safety and anonymity.</blockquote>
     <p>Secondly, they also allow mail clients.</p>
     <p>The wording is very confusing about needing to donate. You don't need to donate to get mail storage, but you do if you want to use Nextcloud.</p>
     <p>Signing up requires using the Nextcloud server (dubbed Ocean) to sign up, which requires an alternate email address. Cock.li appears to work okay though for that, and it can be removed later in Nextcloud settings.</p>
     <p>There also appears to be two different domains, monocles.eu and monocles.de. Both seem to be operated by the same people, especially as both link back to each other.</p>
     <p>I personally use it for my public email address and it works great.</p>
     <p>Site doesn't seem to be using any analytics.</p>
     <h3>Links</h3>

     <h2>Ghosted.ws</h2>
     <p>Service isn't really maintained anymore (as per an email from the admin) and banned my account not long after emailing Dig Deeper (which probably means your emails are being read by humans, yuck!).</p>
     <p>Half of their website is broken and uses most likely improperly licensed AI generated images as icons throughout the site.</p>
     <p>It's also located in a 5 eyes country. So there's that.</p>
     <p>Also, some sister sites have had expired TLS certificates.</p>
     <p>They also were planning on some suspicious residential IP sharing service (essentially a botnet, called "Share 2 Earn").</p>
     <p>I will not be providing links to this service, as I cannot recommend it.</p>
