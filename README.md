# website2

This is my personal website. The name `website2` is a bit misleading, it is due to existing repos on my GitHub account. I've had multiple websites in the past. :two:

This site has been transported multiple times across different infrastructure, between *several* hosting providers. Currently it is being hosted on Cloudflare Pages. :arrow_right:

Source code may be a bit messy, for example a potentially superfluous .nojekyll file is present. :poop:

Likewise, the Git history can be a bit messy too here. :laughing:

To make a new page, just use the 404 page as a template, keeping the back to home link, and change the title of course. :smile: :page_facing_up:
