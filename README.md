# Website

## Introduction

This is my personal website.

This site has been transported multiple times across different infrastructure, between *several* hosting providers. Currently it is being hosted on GitHub.

## Mess disclaimer

Source code may be a bit messy, for example a potentially superfluous .nojekyll file is present.

Likewise, the Git history can be a bit messy too here.

## Making a new page

To make a new page, just use the 404 page as a template, keeping the back to home link, and change the title of course.
