# website2

This is my personal website. The name `website2` is a bit misleading, it is due to existing repos on my GitHub account. I've had multiple websites in the past.

This site has been transported multiple times across different infrastructure, between *several* hosting providers.

Source code may be a bit messy, for example a potentially superfluous .nojekyll file is present.

To make a new page, just use the 404 page as a template, keeping the back to home link, and change the title of course :smile:
